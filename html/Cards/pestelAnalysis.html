                    <h2>Political Factors</h2>
                <p class="text">   - Lebanese Bureaucracy is centralized and authoritarian.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    - Lebanon has been a host to Hezbollah, an internationally labelled terrorist organization that promises to repel the threat of the terrorist state of Israel, while simultaneously endorsing Iran, cutting off most international support, especially after America and Saudi started targeting Iran, and cutting off support for most countries endorsing it. This has caused immense drawbacks in regards to politics, economics, and caused increased rates in corruption, while also limiting the amount of resources, and international help, that Lebanon is able to receive.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    - US News Digital Media noting that Lebanon was the 8th most corrupt country in 2021 worldwide <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/10-most-corrupt-countries-ranked-by-perception?slide=4" target="_blank"> (Atlas,2021)</a>.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    - Taxes are unevenly spread and administered, with some sectors not having to pay any, causing widespread unfairness.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    - Import regulations are very strict, especially after the economic free-fall of the Lebanese currency, wherein the import of many goods has been limited in order to increase purchasing of local goods, for even more monetary gain for corrupt politicians, incentivizing an internal flow of cash, without it leaking away from their grasp.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    -  Freedom of press has recently found more leeway, what with political analysts such as Dima Sadek and Riad Kobeissi having their own shows where they openly discuss corruption and misdemeanors by people in power, with some direct call-outs to the people in question, as opposed to earlier instances of media control where any bad press about a person in power would be matched with sanctions towards the "sullier" (from the verb Sully) who would have "personally attacked" them.

                    <h2>Economic Factors</h2>
                </p>

           
                    <p class="text">   - Economic growth in Lebanon is strictly negative, with a 1777.89% decrease in the currency's value from 2019 to late 2021 (1'515 LBP to 28'450 LBP).</p>
                    <p class="text">   - Inflation rates over basic goods, such as food, clothes, etc, reached about 144.12% in September of 2021 <a href="https://blog.blominvestbank.com/42028/lebanons-inflation-rate-reached-144-12-by-september-2021/#:~:text=In%20more%20details%2C%20the%20average,increased%20over%20the%20studied%20period" target="_blank">(BlomInvest, 2021).</a></p>
                    <p class="text">   - Foreign currencies have been completely taken over by the black market, wherein exchanging one's local currency for foreign currency at banks is no longer possible, and can only take place through less-trusted channels, such as at exchange offices, which set their rates randomly, and force the increase of demand on foreign currencies, in turn decreasing the worth of the local currency.</p> 
                    <p class="text">   - Disposable income has become very limited, with monthly wages for public jobs being worth the same as they did back in 2019, around 750 '000 LBP per month. Most private sectors however, have increased wages to around 2 '500' 000 LBP per month, to match inflation.</p>
                    <p class="text">   - Interest rates at the bank have become null and irrelevant, with a limit as to how much you can take out of your account per month, regardless of your monthly income or your total worth.</p> 
                    <p class="text">   - Price fluctuations are extremely unstable, with every item having a different price tag in different stores.</p>
                    
                </div>
                <div class="container-secondary">
                    <p class="text">
                        <h2>Socio-cultural Factors</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">   - Awareness of health issues, relating to physical, mental, and sexual health, is either extremely silenced, or consdiered to be taboo. Recent campaigns to break stigmas have been launched, and more and more people have come forward with their issues, to try and cope with them through the proper channels.</p>
                    <p class="text">   - Previously, Lebanon used to have a very high level of education, yet has seen a significant decrease in the level of education given to universities and schools, with many professors going abroad. <br>The following statistics come from the UNDP's official website for Quality education, relating to the MENA region: 6 out of 10 children and adolescents are not achieving a minimum level of proficiency in reading and math. <br>The following statistics come from the HRW, in October of 2021: About 700,000 children, a third of the school-age population, received no education last year, and nearly 42,000 children dropped out of school last year alone <a href="" target="_blank">(HRW, 2021).</a></p>
                    <p class="text">   - Classism in Lebanon is seeing an all-time-high, with the rich living comfortably, especially in the current situation, whereas 95% of the population have to make do with the limited amount of money they receive from their jobs, and are suffering greatly due to the immense increase in price inflation. <br>The rich are backed by donors from abroad, with potential investments in wealthy countries, and a safety net with their riches stored abroad, while the poor and suffering can barely take out any money from their savings in their banks. Retired workers cannot rely on funds from their retirement plan, as the amount given to retired workers has not been adjusted in contrast to the inflation in the country.</p>
                    <p class="text">   - Products have lost their value, with imported food of high quality being replaced by their cheaper counterparts, or even local production that fails to equate the level of quality of the original products, such as Nutella, which used to be imported from Poland, but is now being produced and imported from Turkey, with a much lower quality and a different taste.</p>
                    <p class="text">   - Saving money, while having been a previous obsession for the Lebanese populace, has seen the concept completely disappear, with the bank withholding most of the population's savings, and has since been substituted with investments, which was a better way to guarantee one's finances and savings.</p>
                    <p class="text">   - People have varying lifestyles, most of which relate to their level of income. On one hand, many high-end restaurants are jam-packed with people ordering expensive platters and enjoying themselves with their friends despite the increasing inflation, and on the other hand, some households are struggling to provide loaves of bread for their children. <br>This reflects on the activities that people participate in, with many people going out and enjoying leisurely activities, while others are limited to their jobs and houses.</p>

                        <h2>Technological Factors</h2>
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">   - Research and development funding in Lebanon is close to non-existent, yet plans were being set in order to roll them out, but none were registered<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/GB.XPD.RSDV.GD.ZS?locations=LB" target="_blank"> (The World Bank, 2018).</a></p>
                    <p class="text">    - The communication sector in Lebanon charges very high rates for a mediocre service at best, with low reception zones, very limited data allowance per bundle, and high costs <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/lebanon/freedom-net/2020" target="_blank">(Freedom House, 2020).</a></p>
                    <p class="text">    - While many people used to rush to get the newest phones that would have come out from Samsung, Apple and Huawei, this recent year has shown that people have been purchasing used phones at a much higher rate, and are considering repairing their old devices instead of purchasing new ones, given the reduced amount of disposable income that they are able to use.</p>

                            <h2>Environmental Factors</h2>
                        </p>

                    <p class="text">    - Climate change regulation laws are non-existent in Lebanon, with recycling being mostly present to stop any investigations of Lebanon's lack of responsibility towards preserving its environment, leaving the sorting to individuals, who choose to sort or not to sort, then collecting both sorted and unsorted trash equally and disposing of them at the "Mountain of Trash" in Saida.</p></p>
                    <p class="text">    - Climate change is prevalent in Lebanon, mainly observable by the big SMOG clouds produced by factories, such as the Lebanese power plants of Saida and Zouk, variating water levels and wildfires spreading more and more.</p>
                    <p class="text">    - Renewable energy is not endorsed, nor is it a factor in the country's energy production system, but is sometimes used by individual households in order to reduce electrical costs, or in rare cases, with the environment in mind.</p>

                            <h2>Legislative Factors</h2>
                        </p>
                    

                    <p class="text">  - Legislation in Lebanon is never delivered fairly or equally. Entities with a lot of money or influence are almost fully protected from any legal harm if they know how to pull the right strings, which proves to be a very easy process.</p> 
                    <p class="text">  - Minor infractions that are attributed fines can be overlooked and neglected for years without any law enforcement involvement, and lawsuits can last indefinitely if the government decides not to waste resources in investigating cases, or if law enforcement abuses its power to not have any extra work.</p> 
                    <p class="text">  - Law enforcers in Lebanon abuse their power, and oftentimes take part in very violent and unnecessary behavior, such as during the Lebanese revolution, when they would fire expired tear gas canisters, shoot rubber bullets (and hit someone's eye) <a href=”https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/1/21/lebanon-a-lost-eye-the-price-paid-for-demanding-your-rights” target=”_blank”>(Najjar, 2020)</a>, or would beat up peacefully protesting citizens, break their faces and limbs, then throw them in jail <a href=”https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/01/17/lebanon-police-violence-against-protesters” target=”_blank”>(HWR, 2020).</a></p> 
                    <p class="text">  - Laws are put into place to target specific minorities, such as the LGBTQ community (shutting down clubs and events related to LGBTQ activities, harm to these individuals), or Syrian and Palestinian refugees who live in abhorrent situations, in concentration camps with no access to water or food, and with limitations such as a curfew at 7PM to "limit criminal activities". <a href=”https://today.lorientlejour.com/article/1281195/ras-baalbeck-municipality-sets-curfew-and-daily-wage-cap-for-syrian-workers.html” target=”_blank”>(Ramadan, 2021).</a></p>
