        <p  id="contentText"><span> SIDC is a Non-profit Organization that aims to provide relief, assistance, and awareness to people of all demographics, with a heavy focus on minorities, such as the LGBTQ community.</span> 
          <span>Their work revolves around giving awareness and protecting human and gender rights, sexual and reproductive health and rights, while treating and raising awareness about HIV and different STIs, offering tests and medication for said STIs, mostly free of charge.</span><p>
          <span>They also provide harm reduction services, which revolve around substance abuse protection, and offer free therapy for those in need.</span>
          <span>They accept donations, but never charge for their services, except for some STI tests that require a laboratory, and oftentimes distribute free condoms at events to show that protection can be readily available, and will help reduce STI transmission rates.</span>
